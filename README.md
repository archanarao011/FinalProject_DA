Recommendation System for Skin care products

In this project I have tried to do a highly but simple and personalized recommendation of a product for skin care and cosmetics based on

1. user feature similiarities

2.Chemical composition of ingredients 

A Dash model/ Flasp App is developed for the interface of displaying the recommendations. Please run the file front_end.ipynb for that.

Also attempted to predict if a product will get 5-star rating based on its ingredients?Â¶

The data is scraped from the Sephora website.
